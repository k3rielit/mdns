### Content
Currently, there are 2 html files in use.
| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| [index.html](index.html) | A semi-functional tool to upload, parse, and download .rad 3d models. |
| [index2.html](index2.html) | A non-functional page used to test new designs. It'll be merged with index.html once the final look is determined. |
### How use
Just open any of the html files through a browser, or install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to VSCode, then on the bottom right click on Go Live. Then, instead of spamming `F5`/`Ctrl+R`, this will reload the page on every save.
