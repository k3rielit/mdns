### Content
Currently, there's 1 html file in use.
| File | Purpose |
| ---- | ------- |
| [index.html](index.html) | A mostly functional tool to upload, parse, and download .rad 3d models, as well as gather data about the top 20 lists, clans, and published cars. |
### How use
Just open the html files through a browser, or install the [Live Server extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer) to VSCode, then on the bottom right click on Go Live. Then, instead of spamming `F5`/`Ctrl+R`, this will reload the page on every save.
### Todo
- Filter duplicate cars before querying in `cars.html` and `top20.html`.
- Loading screen while fetching, and generating zip.
- Profiles page.
