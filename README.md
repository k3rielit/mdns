## PANEL
A web panel for viewing and editing 3d models for [NFM](http://multiplayer.needformadness.com). It barely survived a school project , and the UI will be dumped as soon as possible in favor of a simpler, more manageable one. Also since it'll be single page, there's no need for 2 navbars.

Currently using vanilla JS, but that may change in the future.

(There are a few example 3d models included in the examples directory.)

## TO-DO
* A usable DOM manipulator interface
* Actual 3d preview
